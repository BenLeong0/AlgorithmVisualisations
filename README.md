# Algorithm Visualisations

## About the project

Visualisations are a useful and important way of understanding complex concepts, and the aim of this project is to provide such visualisations for a range of common algorithms, as well as serving as an exercise in implementing these algorithms in JavaScript.
The page is hosted using GitHub pages [here](https://benleong0.github.io/AlgorithmVisualisations/)

## [Sorting Algorithms](https://benleong0.github.io/AlgorithmVisualisations/sorting/sorting.html)

This page includes visualisations for a number of common sorting algorithms. These algorithms are:

- Quicksort
- Merge sort
- Bubble sort
- Counting sort
- Heapsort
- Radix sort
- Random sort / Bogosort
  - Note: Do not run random sort with > 10 elements, as it is very computationally intensive and essentially neverending.
  - If such a sort is initialised, either reload the page or initalise a different sorting algorithm to override it.

![quicksort example](https://i.imgur.com/I8SkNkD.mp4 "Quicksort")

The objects being sorted are represented by bars of varying lengths, the number of which can be altered by adjusting the slider at the top.
Initilise sortings by clicking on the name of the sort you want to view, and a new array of bars will be generated.

In the future I plan to add information about time and space complexity for each algorithm.
